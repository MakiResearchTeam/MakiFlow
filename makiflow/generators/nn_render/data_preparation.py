    Creates tfrecord dataset where each tfrecord contains `dp_per_second` data points.

    ----------
    images : list or ndarray
        Array of input images.
    uvmaps : list or ndarray
        Array of uvmaps.
    prefix : str
        Prefix for the tfrecords' names. All the filenames will have the same naming pattern:
        `prefix`_`tfrecord index`.tfrecord
    dp_per_record : int
        Data point per tfrecord. Defines how many images (locs, loc_masks, labels) will be
        put into one tfrecord file. It's better to use such `dp_per_record` that
        yields tfrecords of size 300-200 megabytes.
    sess : tf.Session
        In case if you can't or don't want to run TensorFlow eagerly, you can pass in the session object.
