    Creates a Classificator model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_shape : list
        Contains the shape of the input tensor. Must not include the batch dimension.
    n_classes : int
        The number of classes.
    train_batch_size : int
        If provided, an InputLayer with same name and input_shape will be returned, but the
        batch dimension will be set to `train_batch_size`.

    Returns
    -------
    Classificator
        The classificator model.
    InputLayer
        Training input layer with the specified `train_batch_size` batch size.
        The input layer is not returned if `train_batch_size` is not provided.
