# MakiFlow
This is a machine learning open source library built on top of TensorFlow. It is made to suit our team needs and accelerate our research process. It utilises Keras like high level API but runs low level TensorFlow code, thus, works faster than pure Keras. It does not support arbitrary models like Keras does, instead it provides a set of already built models for classification, object detection and segmentation purposes, though you still allowed to build your own models using MakiFlow components if you're familiar with TensorFlow low-level API.
# Installation
